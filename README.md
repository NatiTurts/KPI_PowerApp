# KPI_PowerApp
A KPI Management PowerApps template

Figured it was time to share an app with the community so here it is :)

A KPI Management App template that is simple to import and get you started with grading employees on your KPI measurements.
The app is very customisable to suit your required taste and is configured using a SharePoint site.

To get started with the App, you will need to create a SharePoint site and import the provided tables. You will also need to configure some of the tables with additional columns/formulas and defaults.

Once configured, the App and the flows can be imported as well. 
Ensure that you edit the flow in line with the instructions to ensure the files can be pulled from the app to SharePoint.

Once you have imported the App into PowerApps, you will need to connect to the following connections:
  Office 365 Outlook
  SharePoint List [Your Site] Documents
  SharePoint List [Your Site] KPI
  SharePoint List [Your Site] Setup
  SharePoint List [Your Site] Theme
  SharePoint List [Your Site] Grades
  SharePoint List [Your Site] Staff
  SharePoint List [Your Site] Users
  Apply Action to Button >> Select KPI Logo Upload
  
After setting up these Connections, be sure to refresh them all and check that there are no warnings in the App. It should be ready for publishing.

Shout-out to R3dKap (Emmanuel GALLIS) for the amazing Ultimate Colour Picker PowerApps component used in this app.

Enjoy
